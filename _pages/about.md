I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in computer science. I'm advised by Professor [Josiah Hanna](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jphanna/index.html). My research is focused on enabling intelligent agent to perform complex tasks in the real world. Toward this end, I work on reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning that enables agents to learn through interaction.
